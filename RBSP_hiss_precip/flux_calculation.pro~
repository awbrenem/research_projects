;Calculate the flux of e- scattered into loss cone on RBSP

;Jan 3rd, 2014 for time 20:05 UT


;Here's what I'm doing. By knowing the pitch angle diffusion rate I can find how far in
;pitch angle an electron will scatter in a single bounce period. (Half of) Electrons within this 
;angular distance from the loss cone will be lost in this time. If I take into account the
;entire 2*Pi solid angle, all electrons within this "thin slice" are lost. 
;For simplicity, I'm using the MagEIS differential flux at the 8 deg pitch angle and assuming
;that the DLC is at 7 deg pitch angle (I find that e- will scatter by ~1 deg in pitch angle
;each bounce.)


	t = '2014-01-03/20:05'

;Start with MagEIS differential flux at 8 deg PA, 30 keV  (from Joe Fennell)
	df30 = 8d4   ;#/cm2/s/sr/keV
	df50 = 9d4
	df80 = 4d4


;Normally you'd multiply this by the geometric factor to get #/s. Geometric
;factor takes into account the effective detector area, angular bin size (via solid angle term), 
;and energy bin size. 

;GF = dA * SA * dE   

;However, we're not interested in the MagEIS solid angle, but the #/s in the "thin slice"
;solid angle. So, I can't use the geometric factor
;as is. To get around this I'll find
;each of the terms that make up the geometric factor and use the "thin slice"
;solid angle. 


;Energy term
;	dE = 14.3  ;keV  energy acceptance of 30 keV channel  (Table 1, Blake et al., 2013)
	dE30 = 8.    ;From Joe Fennell's email   
	dE50 = 9.
	dE80 = 12.
	
;Area term. Get from  GF = dA * SA * dE   -->  dA = GF/SA/dE
;In this case SA is the solid angle of the MagEIS detector, and not the "thin slice" solid angle
	;GF30 = 0.0526  ;Geometric factor
	;GF50 = 0.0607
	;GF80 = 0.0663


	;Solid angle of MagEIS detector at a pitch angle of 8 deg.
	dtheta30 = 7.8 ;MagEIS angular bin size (Table 1)
	dtheta50 = 6.4
	dtheta80 = 5.6
	
;	SA230 = 2*!pi*sin(8.*!dtor)*dtheta30*!dtor
;	SA250 = 2*!pi*sin(8.*!dtor)*dtheta50*!dtor
;	SA280 = 2*!pi*sin(8.*!dtor)*dtheta80*!dtor

	;Effective area of detector
;	dA30 = GF30/dE30/SA230   ;cm^2
;	dA50 = GF50/dE50/SA250   ;cm^2
;	dA80 = GF80/dE80/SA280   ;cm^2


;Now find the "thin slice" solid angle term.
;To get this I need to know how far an electron will random walk in a single
;bounce period.

	;bounce-averaged diffusion coeff for 30 keV
	Daa30 = 0.00014   ;1/s
	Daa50 = 8.12d-5
	Daa80 = 5.00d-5


	;Bounce period
	ang = 8.  ;Pitch angle
	L = 5.0   ;Lshell
	;bounce period for 30 keV e- at 8 deg pitch angle at L=5.2
	Tb30 = 5.62d-2 * L * (1-0.43*sin(ang*!dtor))/sqrt(30./1000.)
	Tb50 = 5.62d-2 * L * (1-0.43*sin(ang*!dtor))/sqrt(50./1000.)
	Tb80 = 5.62d-2 * L * (1-0.43*sin(ang*!dtor))/sqrt(80./1000.)



	;Random walk distance Daa = dangle^2/2tb  (Kennel69 eqn3) 
	dangle30 = sqrt(Daa30*2*Tb30)/!dtor  ;degrees randomly walked in one bounce
	dangle50 = sqrt(Daa50*2*Tb50)/!dtor  ;degrees randomly walked in one bounce
	dangle80 = sqrt(Daa80*2*Tb80)/!dtor  ;degrees randomly walked in one bounce

	;"thin slice" solid angle
	SA30 = 2*!pi*sin(8*!dtor) * dangle30*!dtor
	SA50 = 2*!pi*sin(8*!dtor) * dangle50*!dtor
	SA80 = 2*!pi*sin(8*!dtor) * dangle80*!dtor


;Now I can solve for the #/s of electrons lost to DLC each bounce for the area
;the size of the MagEIS detector. 
	n30 = df30 * SA30 * dE30   ;#/sec/cm^2 (30 keV MagEIS bin only)
	n50 = df50 * SA50 * dE50   ;#/sec/cm^2 (30 keV MagEIS bin only)
	n80 = df80 * SA80 * dE80   ;#/sec/cm^2 (30 keV MagEIS bin only)
	
	n30 = n30 * tb30				;#/bounce/cm^2
	n50 = n50 * tb50				;#/bounce/cm^2
	n80 = n80 * tb80				;#/bounce/cm^2

;Of these electrons in the "thin slice" half will random walk to the DLC and the other
;half to higher pitch angles. So, 
	n30 = n30/2.
	n50 = n50/2.
	n80 = n80/2.
;This result isn't too useful b/c it's only the #/s passing tiny MagEIS detector



;;Divide out the MagEIS detector area
;	n30 = n30/dA30    ;#/sec/cm^2
;	n50 = n50/dA50    ;#/sec/cm^2
;	n80 = n80/dA80    ;#/sec/cm^2

that are lost in a single bounce. So, it's a rate
