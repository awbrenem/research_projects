;Calculate the flux of e- scattered into loss cone on RBSP

;Jan 3rd, 2014 for time 20:05 UT


;Here's what I'm doing. By knowing the pitch angle diffusion rate I can find how far in
;pitch angle an electron will scatter in a single bounce period. (Half of) Electrons within this 
;angular distance from the loss cone will be lost in this time. If I take into account the
;entire 2*Pi solid angle, all electrons within this "thin slice" are lost. 
;For simplicity, I'm using the MagEIS differential flux at the 8 deg pitch angle and assuming
;that the DLC is at 7 deg pitch angle (I find that e- will scatter by ~1 deg in pitch angle
;each bounce.)


	t = '2014-01-03/20:05'

;Start with MagEIS differential flux at 8 deg PA, 50 keV  (from Joe Fennell)
	df = 9d4   ;e-/cm2/s/sr/keV   (IS THIS ACTUALLY PER KEV? OR IS IT FOR THE ENTIRE 8 DEG WIDE BIN???)

;; ;Energy bin width (not used at this time)
 	dE = 9.

 ;       df50 = df50/dE50
	
;MagEIS angular bin size at 8 deg (Table 1, Blake et al., 2013)
	dtheta = 6.4
	

;Now find the "thin slice" solid angle term.
;To get this I need to know how far an electron will random walk in a single
;bounce period.

	;bounce-averaged diffusion coeff for 30 keV
	Daa = 8.12d-5  ;1/s


 	;Bounce period
	ang = 8.  ;Pitch angle
	L = 5.0   ;Lshell
	;bounce period for 30 keV e- at 8 deg pitch angle at L=5.2
	Tb = 5.62d-2 * L * (1-0.43*sin(ang*!dtor))/sqrt(50./1000.) ;=1.2 s


                                ;Since Tb50 ~ 1 sec, instead of
                                ;integrating over a bounce period (as
                                ;was done in calculation of
                                ;bounce-averaged diffusion
                                ;coeff, we'll just leave every
                                ;thing in 1/s



	;Random walk distance in single bounce <Daa> = dangle^2/2tb  (Kennel69 eqn3)
	dangle = sqrt(Daa*2*Tb)/!dtor  ;=0.8 deg

	;"thin slice" solid angle
	SA = 2*!pi*sin(8*!dtor) * dangle*!dtor ;=0.012


;Now I can solve for the #/s/cm2/keV of electrons lost (from MagEIS)
	nm = df * SA   


;Of these electrons in the "thin slice" half will random walk to the DLC and the other
;half to higher pitch angles. So, 
	nm = nm/2. ;=545 e-/s/cm2/keV


;BARREL e-/s/cm2 50 keV (from Michael McCarthy's email)
        nb = 260   ;e-/cm2/s/keV  for 50 keV only from (20:13-20:19 UT on Jan 3rd)

	;; ;nb = 1054641.8 ;e-/cm2/s  (OLD NUMBER)




;But, we have to account for the enhanced flux caused by 
;conservation of flux in narrowing flux tube
;Find ratio of B2/B1 = A1/A2

	ilat = acos(sqrt(1/L))/!dtor  ;invariant latitude

	.compile ~/Desktop/community/dipole.pro
	dip = dipole(L)

	plot,dip.r - 6370.,yrange=[0,700]
	radius = dip.r - 6370.
	boo = where(radius le 70.)
	boo = boo[0]

	Bo_70km = dip.b[boo]    ;Bo_70km = 53505 nT
	Bo_mageq = 160.   ;nT  at 20:05 UT

 
        Bratio = Bo_70km/Bo_mageq ;=334
         



;--------------------------------------------------
;Compare BARREL and RBSP observations
;--------------------------------------------------

        ;What should be observed by BARREL is the MagEIS flux
        ;scaled by Bratio

        nb2 = nm * Bratio   

        print,nb2/nb ;=700  (should equal 1 if BARREL and MagEIS calculations agree)
