;; Aaron:
;; Just for the heck of it, I fit the MagEIS spectra around 20 UT and came up with the following double-maxwellian fit 

;; J ~ 4.7E5 x exp(-E/25.8) + 7.7E3 x exp(-E/197) with E in keV and J in electrons/(cm2 s sr keV) 

;; Integrating from 50 keV to 1 MeV and dividing by 4Ï€ gives 

;; I~2.6E5 electrons/(cm2 s). 

;; Is that the sort of number you are using? 



;Result = QROMB( Func, A, B [, /DOUBLE] [, EPS=value] [, JMAX=value] [, K=value] )
