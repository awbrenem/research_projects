Header file for RBSP?_FU?_conjunction_values_yyyymmdd_hhmmss.txt (see master_conjunction_list_part5.pro)
RBSP values are within +/- "time_extent" sec of middle conjunction time.
NOTE1: many entries have missing FIREBIRD data, including ephemeris. This is correct, and is more prevalent early in the mission...
...During these time the RBSP L and MLT values are taken as the AVERAGE value during the conjunction, not the values at the closest approach, which is undefined
NOTE2: the majority of conjunctions have no FIREBIRD hires data. See the FBb column.
