Here's the chain of processing that delivered these files. 


Mykhaylo Shumko created these files (see folder Schumko_conjunction_lists): 
	FU3_RBSPA_conjunctions_dL10_dMLT10_final.txt
	FU3_RBSPB_conjunctions_dL10_dMLT10_final.txt
	FU4_RBSPA_conjunctions_dL10_dMLT10_final.txt
	FU4_RBSPB_conjunctions_dL10_dMLT10_final.txt

for each conjunction b/t FIREBIRD and RBSP that occurs within delta-Lshell=1 and delta-MLT=1 hr. 

They contain:
startTime,endTime,meanL,meanMLT,minMLT,minD [km]

This is somewhat useful, but I really want better info than the mean L and MLT, etc. 
So, I use these files for the start and end conjunction times and min separation in the 
program master_conjunction_list_part3.pro. This program outputs the following files: 

	RBSPa_FU3_conjunction_values.txt
	RBSPa_FU4_conjunction_values.txt
	RBSPb_FU3_conjunction_values.txt
	RBSPb_FU4_conjunction_values.txt

or (for conjunctions that include FIREBIRD HiRes data)

	RBSPa_FU3_conjunction_values_hr.txt
	RBSPa_FU4_conjunction_values_hr.txt
	RBSPb_FU3_conjunction_values_hr.txt
	RBSPb_FU4_conjunction_values_hr.txt



These have the following:

NOTE1: many entries have missing FIREBIRD data, including ephemeris. This is correct, and is more prevelant early in the mission...
...During these time the RBSP L and MLT values are taken as the AVERAGE value during the conjunction, not the values at the closest approach, which is undefined
NOTE2: the majority of conjunctions have no FIREBIRD hires data. See the FBb column.


Notes on missing FIREBIRD ephemeris (Arlo Johnson email on July 28, 2020): 
I think Mike is probably correct that you're looking at campaigns when the spacecraft 
were only operating in the northern hemisphere. I just flipped back through the early 
campaigns and found campaigns 1-7 were northern hemisphere only. I've attached the L 
summary plots from those campaigns. There are a few other data gaps, I don't know the 
cause of those. There are also times when we have data in both hemispheres or sometimes 
southern only. These are often associated with the start of a month when a known bug in 
calculating epochs will occur and then fixed a few days into the month.

There have been other times when the spacecraft were not operating full orbit in 
campaigns 8+, but you should find much more continuous data at that point. There will 
still be a few random dropouts here and there. Of particular note is FU4 campaign 14 was 
the first time we saw the time stamp bug that recently happened again to cut campaign 28 
short, so much of that campaign is missing.
Unfortunately we do not have any usable count data that's not published online, so there's 
no filling in the gaps.
