Header file for RBSP?_FU?_conjunction_values.txt and RBSP?_FU?_conjunction_values_hr.txt files 
RBSP values are within +/-60 min of middle conjunction time
NOTE1: many entries have missing FIREBIRD data, including ephemeris. This is correct, and is more prevalent early in the mission...
...During these time the RBSP L and MLT values are taken as the AVERAGE value during the conjunction, not the values at the closest approach, which is undefined
NOTE2: the majority of conjunctions have no FIREBIRD hires data. See the FBb column.

Tstart: start of conjunction
Tend: end of conjunction
Tmin: time of closest conjunction (defined from minimum absolute separation)
Lrb: L value (rbspa) during min separation time
Lfb: L value (FU3) during min separation time
MLTrb: MLT value (rbspa) during min separation time
MLTfb: MLT value (FU3) during min separation time
distmin: minimum |separation| in RE b/t rbspa and FU3 at Tminsep
dLmin: |delta L| of rbspa) during min separation time
dMLTmin: |delta MLT| of rbspa) during min separation time
colS: max collimated detector FB survey flux during conjunction (NOT detrended. Doesn't do any good. Rather, this is only useful as a measure of overall precip)
colHR: max collimated detector FB hires flux during conjunction (detrended over 0.75 sec to get rid of roll variation and isolate microbursts)
