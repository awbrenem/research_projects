;Microbursts identified for the 2017-12-05 event for the Frontiers paper 

;-------------------------------------------
;Two types of microbursts identified:
;TYPE I
;Clear microbursts that I can use to plot spectra
;   Must be <=500 msec in duration
;   Must have a roughly Gaussian profile (singly-peaked) in all channels
;   Can't show any dramatic dispersion, which could be from drift.
;TYPE II
;Ancillary microbursts: ADDITIONAL MICROBURST EVENTS. THESE ARE EITHER
;   1) CLUSTERED EVENTS, WHICH MEANS I CAN'T ACCURATELY TELL DURATION OR AMPLITUDE (DUE TO SUPERPOSITION)
;   2) NOT STRICTLY GAUSSIAN IN NATURE 
;   3) HAVE TOO MUCH DISPERSION
;   4) Data dropout
;IT IS IMPORTANT TO TRACK THESE ANYWAYS SO SADIE CAN MAP THEM ON HER DIAL PLOTS


;-------------------------------------------

;tpeak = time of peak flux (generally channel 1)
;fluxpeak = Peak flux per channel
;bgleft = background level at start of microburst
;bgright = background level at end of microburst
;tstart = Start time of microburst for each channel
;tstop = Stop time of microburst for each channel
