Here's the chain of processing that delivered these files. 


Mykhaylo Shumko created these files: 
	FU3_RBSPA_conjunctions_dL10_dMLT10_final.txt
	FU3_RBSPB_conjunctions_dL10_dMLT10_final.txt
	FU4_RBSPA_conjunctions_dL10_dMLT10_final.txt
	FU4_RBSPB_conjunctions_dL10_dMLT10_final.txt

For each conjunction b/t FIREBIRD and RBSP they contain:
startTime,endTime,meanL,meanMLT,minMLT,minD [km]

This is somewhat useful, but I really want better info than the mean L and MLT, etc. 
So, I use these files for the start and end conjunction times and min separation in the 
program master_conjunction_list_part3.pro. This program outputs the following files: 

	RBSPa_FU3_conjunction_values.txt
	RBSPa_FU4_conjunction_values.txt
	RBSPb_FU3_conjunction_values.txt
	RBSPb_FU4_conjunction_values.txt

These have the following:

Conjunction data for RBSPa and FU3 from Shumko file FU3_RBSPA_conjunctions_dL10_dMLT10_hr_final.txt
Tstart = start of conjunction
Tend = end of conjunction
Tmin = time of closest conjunction (defined from minimum absolute separation)
Lmin = L value (rbspa) during min separation time
MLTmin = MLT value (rbspa) during min separation time
distmin = minimum |separation| in km b/t rbspa and FU3 at Tminsep
dLmin = |delta L| of rbspa) during min separation time
dMLTmin = |delta MLT| of rbspa) during min separation time
col = max collumated detector FB flux during conjunction
sur = max surface detector FB flux during conjunction
EMFb = number of sec of EMFISIS burst data within +/-60 min of middle conjunction time
B1b = number of sec of EFW burst 1 data within +/-60 min of middle conjunction time
B2b = number of sec of EFW burst 2 data within +/-60 min of middle conjunction time
The remaining columns are max EFW filter bank amplitudes (pT, mV/m) within +/-60 min of middle conjunction time

This is all well and good, but I still don't have accurate values for the FIREBIRD sats. 
I create these with firebird_create_ephem_for_conjunctions.py, which loads the previous files 
and adds accurate FIREBIRD position data.
